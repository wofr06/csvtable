.SH NAME
csvtable \- Tabular view of csv files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B csvtable
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIFILENAME\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tabular view of input from a file or STDIN which consists of comma separated
values. The program tries to be as fault tolerant as possible: e.g. mixed utf-8
and non utf-8 chars may get displayed correctly, the delimiter for csv fields
is normally guessed from the list of (, ; | : and TAB) characters, the field
width is guessed and kept at minimal size. Empty lines will not be displayed.
The program tolerates bad quoting, lines with varying number of fields, etc.
and keeps warning and error messages at the bare minimum.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c number_or_range --columns=number_or_range
Display only given columns (number or range, e.g. 1,3-5). If that leads to a
line with empty fields only, that line will not be displayed. The columns get
displayed in the order given by the sequence of field numbers and ranges. Even
an inverted range is accepted (e.g. for -c 5-3,1 the columns 5,4,3,1 arer
isplayed in that order)
.TP
.B \-d character --delimiter=character
Overrides the guessed delimiting character
.TP
.B \-h --help
Print a short help text
.TP
.B \-H --no-header-row
Do not assume a header line
.TP
.B \-l --linenumbers
Add a first column containing the line number. That is useful to identify
empty lines or (using \-c number) to display non empty fields in a single
column together with the line numbers.
.TP
.B \-o string --output-field-separator=string
This overrides the default drawing of the frames around the table and the
columns, which is inspired by the \fBrich\fP --csv output. More than one char
can be given. Before the leftmost column and after the rightmost column
white space in the string before respectively after any nonblank chars will
be removed.
.TP
.B \-q character --quotechar=character
Override the default quote character (")
.TP
.B \-y #_of_lines --snifflimit=#_of_lines
Number of lines to determine the field width of the columns. The default is
1000 lines, for \-y 0 all lines get analyzed. As the lines get temporarily
stored in memory, do not use that option for huge files. That option is also
used for guessing the field delimiter, if in the first line[s] no delimiter
is found.
.TP
.B \-z max_field_size --maxfieldsize=max_field_size
The maximum field width for a column. Contents that exceeds the size, is
wrapped on continuing lines (max_field_size > 0) or truncated (size < 0).
